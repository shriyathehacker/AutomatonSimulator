<h1>Automaton Simulator</h1>
<p>I read Kozen, Dexter. Automata and Computability / Dexter C. Kozen. New York, NY: Springer, 1997.
<br>From this I was inspired to make a simulator to simulate a deterministic finite automaton
<br>I can then plug in different strings to see how different automaton's behave.
<br>In the source code is a automaton to detect whether the string "481" appears in the input
<br> This was taken from the Homework 1 challenge on page 301
